Transcript of 2nd Session between Charles Balis, M.D. and
Ms. Eliza Raven, Tuesday, February 18, 1997 at 12 pm.

       Dr. Balis:   Hello Eliza.

     Ms. Raven:     Good afternoon Dr. Balis. I hope you
                    received my letter?

       Dr. Balis:   Yes I did.

     Ms. Raven:     Very good. Well, here is the list Luke
                    provided me. I hope that you don't wish to
                    stick to it, because I surely do not.

       Dr. Balis:   Let's see: "The Weather, Sports, Work,
                    Music and your band, the News, Animals,
                    and your Wedding Plans." I don't know, I
                    think I might like discussing the weather.

     Ms. Raven:     Good heavens Doctor! You're not serious!

       Dr. Balis:   No I'm not. Why don't we forget about
                    Luke's list right now and just talk about
                    what you want to talk about.

     Ms. Raven:     First off, let's not discuss my childhood
                    right now. I find that it's rather boring and
                    dreary. This is not just Luke's orders; it's
                    my wish not to speak of it. I'd rather work
                    backward, if that's okay with you.

       Dr. Balis:   That's fine. You mentioned that you are
                    subject to crying spells in your letter.

     Ms. Raven:     Yes. I have them quite frequently. In fact,
                    more frequently than I would like.

       Dr. Balis:   Is there anything in particular that triggers
                    them?
Ms. Raven:    It's usually something or other. Like the
              other day, I came home from work and
              started reflecting about my day. I
              remembered our session and it made me
              a little sad about my poor relationship with
              my mother. Well, Luke walks in from work.
              He asks me how my day was and I told
              him I was feeling a bit shaky about seeing
              you for the first time, but that it was
              nothing to worry about. He asked me what
              we talked about,and I told him nothing in
              particular. Well Luke knows me better
              than that and he started to grill me about
              it. Before I know it, I'm sobbing about
              having to talk about Mother and he goes
              off. He was ranting and raving and
              swearing and cursing. It was horrible.
              Before I knew it, he was hopping in his car
              and speeding off to your office to have a
              word with you. Apparently, you had
              already left for the day and so he came
              back home. He said his work with you
              was far from finished.

 Dr. Balis:   Hmm...

Ms. Raven:    Well, that's how one of the episodes
              started. Others are brought on by
              nervousness, stress, anger. It's actually
              quite a release. It's my way of coping with
              the big bad world out there.

 Dr. Balis:   How often do you have these episodes?

Ms. Raven:    The minimum is once a week. The
              maximum is twice a day.

 Dr. Balis:   When did you start having them?

Ms. Raven:    About two years now. Not a day goes by
              when I'm not thinking whether I'm going to
              have another one. I worry about how long
              it will last and whether I'll have enough
              kerchiefs for my nosebleeds.

 Dr. Balis:   Your crying sessions are accompanied by
              nosebleeds?

Ms. Raven:    Almost always.

 Dr. Balis:   Tell me something. How do you feel about
              Luke?

Ms. Raven:    I love him. With all of my heart and soul.
              It's like I'm in a fantasy land, and it's just
              me and him. He's chivalrous, beautiful,
              wonderful. Any woman would be glad to
              have him around. I'm a lucky woman.

 Dr. Balis:   Does Luke always stand up for you?

Ms. Raven:    An example?

 Dr. Balis:   His phone call to me, for example.

Ms. Raven:    Oh, I knew it! You are upset about that
              phone call! I begged him not to...I
              pleaded! I was on my hands and knees,
              for Christ's sake! He is extremely
              overprotective of me and anything that
              upsets me upsets him as well. He did it to
              vent his aggression, not to defend me! I
              wanted to talk about Mother, I swear! Oh
              please believe me!
 Dr. Balis:   Of course I believe you. I'm sorry Eliza, I
              didn't mean to upset you. Here're the
              tissues.

Ms. Raven:    I don't need them, thank you. I think I
              might want to go home now.

 Dr. Balis:   I don't think that would help you with your
              problems.

Ms. Raven:    I don't know! I just can't make up my own
              mind!

 Dr. Balis:   Eliza...

Ms. Raven:    Do you want me to stay? Well do you?!

 Dr. Balis:   Eliza, I...

Ms. Raven:    Oh, you do not wish it! I knew it, I knew it,
              I knew it! Nobody wants me around, not
              even my own therapist!

 Dr. Balis:   Eliza!


Ms. Raven:    Yes, good Doctor?

 Dr. Balis:   Please calm down. Let's work this
              through.

Ms. Raven:    All right. I will stay then. But only because
              you want me to. Blast these nosebleeds!

 Dr. Balis:   It is my desire to help you work through
              your problems, not to make up your mind
              for you.

Ms. Raven:    Then your're the only one who will let me
              make up my own mind.

 Dr. Balis:   Is that really true, Eliza?

Ms. Raven:    Yes.

 Dr. Balis:   Who else makes your decisions?

Ms. Raven:    Everyone! My Mother, Luke, his Mother,
              Isaac, Camille, Josie, Robin, Anders, my
              co-workers, my bosses, Luke's extended
              family, my extended family, Everyone I
              know makes up my mind for me!

 Dr. Balis:   I noticed that you didn't mention your
              father.

Ms. Raven:    Even he does it sometimes! "Oh dear,
              you're not strong enough to make a
              decision on that." He can piss off, and so
              can the rest of them! They make me so
              angry! I hate them, I hate them, I hate
              them!

 Dr. Balis:   Have you ever tried to stand up for
              yourself?

Ms. Raven:    Yes. A couple times. It didn't go over well.

 Dr. Balis:   What about Luke's father?

Ms. Raven:    Dead. Car accident. Two years ago. He
              was driving home from one of my band's
              gigs and he was a little bit drunk. Head-on
              collision. I was lucky I was thrown from
              the car.

 Dr. Balis:   You were in that accident?

Ms. Raven:    I do not want to talk about it.
 Dr. Balis:   Okay. Let's go back to what happened
              when you tried to stand up for yourself.

Ms. Raven:    It happened so fast...

 Dr. Balis:   Pardon?

Ms. Raven:    I am sorry, I was a bit distracted. I was
              saying that the accident happened so fast.
              The last thing I heard was him scream
              and then I was soaring and I skidded on
              my face...

 Dr. Balis:   Ow.

Ms. Raven:    Yeah it did hurt. I remembered waking up
              in a hospital room and Luke standing over
              me, tears streaking down his face. I was
              so touched. I'd never seen him cry.

 Dr. Balis:   You were surprised to see him crying?

Ms. Raven:    Well c'mon. Wouldn't you be surprised to
              see a former athlete crying his eyes out?


 Dr. Balis:   I guess I could be.

Ms. Raven:    Well he was crying, saying over and over,
              "He's dead, dead Liz, dead. He's dead Liz.
              He's dead."

 Dr. Balis:   His father?

Ms. Raven:    Yes. I was out for a week. His father died
              and so did the baby I was carrying.

 Dr. Balis:   You were pregnant?

Ms. Raven:    It was really too soon for me to tell. My
              periods have always been at odd
              intervals, so two months without one was
              no big deal for me.

 Dr. Balis:   Does Luke know that you miscarried in
              the accident?

Ms. Raven:    Yes. I talked with my doctor after I came
              out of my coma, and asked him what
              happened. He told me that I had
              miscarried in the accident. I felt it was my
              duty that Luke should know--he's so family
              oriented. I had to tell him; I couldn't get
              away with not telling him. It took me a
              week to work up the courage.

 Dr. Balis:   How did that talk go?

Ms. Raven:    Not well at all. At first he laughed and said
              that it was a morbid attempt to try to cheer
              him up after his father had died. I kept
              insisting that there was no way I was lying
              and I got so emotionally worked up, that
              he finally believed me.

 Dr. Balis:   And?

Ms Raven:     All hell broke loose. He had a complete
              and total cow, if you don't mind me
              saying. Suddenly it was my fault that his
              father had died, and it was my intention to
              miscarry the baby. It was all my fault! All
              mine!

 Dr. Balis:   You weren't driving. How could it have
              been your fault?
Ms. Raven:    Oh, try telling that to Luke. Eventually,
              after the breakdowns started, he stopped
              and laid off me. He can't stand to see me
              cry or in pain in any way. So I guess that
              resolves that.

 Dr. Balis:   Are you taking medication for the
              accident?

Ms. Raven:    Yes. I have to take painkillers for all sorts
              of things--Percocets. I was thrown face
              first. They had to do reconstructive
              surgery. They did a damned good job, no
              scars whatsoever. Well a few but, you
              know, not any noticeable ones. I broke
              both arms, a leg, and I got a concussion. I
              almost scraped all the flesh off my arms
              during that skid. After Luke told me that
              his father had died, I was in a coma for a
              week. I was in the hospital longer.
              Multiple fractions. Reconstructive surgery.
              Physical therapy. Pain, pain, pain. All the
              time. I couldn't write for awhile. Luke
              bought me a mini-cassette recorder for
              that. I put it in my lap top when I could
              type again. But it was a long time before I
              healed from that. And I have yet to begin
              healing emotionally. I have a recurring
              nightmare about it.

 Dr. Balis:   Tell me about that.

Ms. Raven:    Well, in my dream I'm sitting in Gary's car-
              -Gary was Luke's father--and I'm holding a
              baby in my lap. We're rolling along at a
              slow pace when suddenly I grab the wheel
              and swing one leg over the console and
              press the gas. We are careening toward
              another car, when I fling myself out the
              door, leaving Gary in the car. I take the
              baby with me. So I roll away. I look up in
              time to see the cars crash. And I start
              laughing hysterically. The baby starts to
              cry, and I begin to tear it apart, limb by
              limb. It's a little girl. Then I begin to walk
              away, still laughing. But then I turn around
              and Gary's pulling himself out of the
              wreckage. He starts to chase me, even
              though he's all mangled and everything.
              He's like a zombie, like "Thriller" and I
              start to scream. But then the baby pulls
              itself together and starts to toddle after
              me, zombie fashion. I turn around and run
              and run and run. They get closer. I feel
              Gary scrape the flesh on my arms. The
              baby manages to get my face. They
              corner me and close in, their rotting, putrid
              faces grinning and cackling. Then I wake
              up.

 Dr. Balis:   How often do you have this dream?

Ms. Raven:    Oh about every two months. I wake up
              screaming.

 Dr. Balis:   What do you think the dream means?
      Ms. Raven:      I think it is me internalizing the guilt that I
                      have about the wreck. They didn't know
                      what the gender of the baby was, but I
                      know, deep down inside somewhere, that
                      it was a little girl. And I could have taken
                      the keys from Gary but I didn't have the
                      guts to. Besides, he had driven home tipsy
                      before, so this time was really nothing
                      different. I would have named her Callista
                      Dominique.

         Dr. Balis:   Do mind if we discuss this some more in
                      our next session?

      Ms. Raven:      We certainly can, Doctor Balis.

         Dr. Balis:   Okay. How about this same time next
                      Tuesday. That'll be the 25th of February
                      at noon.

      Ms. Raven:      That sounds fine. I'll see you then.

         Dr. Balis:   Take care Eliza. Oh, and Eliza?

      Ms. Raven:      Yes?

         Dr. Balis:   Feel free to call me any time you need
                      me, okay? I'm just a phone call away.

       Ms Raven:      Very well then. I'm going to go commune
                      with the trees now.

         Dr. Balis:   Goodbye Eliza.

      Ms. Raven:      Bye bye Dr. Balis. And thank you.

         Dr. Balis:   You're quite welcome.
