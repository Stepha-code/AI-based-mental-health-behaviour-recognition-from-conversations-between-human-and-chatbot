Transcript of 1st Session between Charles Balis, M.D. and
Ms. Nicole Ulreich, Monday, March 30, 1998 at 2:00 pm.

     Ms. Ulreich:   Hi. You must be Doctor Balis.

       Dr. Balis:   Hello. You must be Nicole.

     Ms. Ulreich:   Yeah. Um, I'm kind of nervous. This is the
                    first time I've ever been to a psycho-
                    doctor.

       Dr. Balis:   Well, there's nothing to worry about. I
                    won't bite.

     Ms. Ulreich:   I kind of figured that.

       Dr. Balis:   Good. Why don't you sit down and we'll
                    talk for awhile.

     Ms. Ulreich:   Fine. But there's nothing wrong with my
                    life. It's just peachy.

       Dr. Balis:   Oh? Then why are you here?

     Ms. Ulreich:   My way overprotective mother sent me
                    here. She thinks I have a drug problem.

       Dr. Balis:   Does she have any reason to think that?

     Ms. Ulreich:   My friend Angela was caught with cocaine
                    in her room. My mom figured that since
                    Angie and I are best friends that we must
                    both do drugs. I mean, excuse me?

       Dr. Balis:   Do you use drugs?

     Ms. Ulreich:   I wouldn't call it "using."

       Dr. Balis:   What would you call it?

     Ms. Ulreich:   Playing around.

       Dr. Balis:   Could you please explain what you mean
                    by "playing around?"

     Ms. Ulreich:   It means I do drugs every once in a while.
                    Like at a party, for example. And
                    sometimes when I'm down. And
                    sometimes when I'm happy and all. But it
                    isn't an all the time thing like it is with
                    Angie. She does get excessive. But I'm
                    supposed to talk about me not her, right?

       Dr. Balis:   It's okay to talk about your friends. And it
                    sounds like you're worried about her.
                    Have you ever considered telling Angie's
                    parents about her drug problem?

     Ms. Ulreich:   You know the saying, "Friends don't let
                    friends drive drunk?"
  Dr. Balis:   Yes, I believe that's true.


Ms. Ulreich:   Well, the reason I don't tell her parents is
               because friends don't let friends get
               grounded either. Can you imagine what
               they'd do to her? Not to mention that
               they'd tell my parents, and then my
               parents would be convinced that I've been
               using drugs, too.

  Dr. Balis:   I see. Do you think your friend is likely to
               get hurt if she continues to use drugs?

Ms. Ulreich:   Probably.

  Dr. Balis:   Do you think that telling her parents might
               even save her life?

Ms. Ulreich:   I guess that might be true.

  Dr. Balis:   I think that getting grounded is a small
               price to pay for saving your friend's life,
               don't you?

Ms. Ulreich:   She's my best friend.

  Dr. Balis:   Well then.

Ms. Ulreich:   She has a child psychiatrist. I think her
               name is Doctor Francisco. Angie said
               she's great.

  Dr. Balis:   I'm glad that your friend is getting help.

Ms. Ulreich:   Yeah, me too.

  Dr. Balis:   How do you feel about Angie's problem
               with drugs?

Ms. Ulreich:   I'm angry and sad, and I just feel icky!

  Dr. Balis:   Icky?

Ms. Ulreich:   When I think of her problems, it makes
               my skin crawl. I think it could be me, or it
               could be worse. She could be driven to
               kill. She could kill herself. And what would
               I do without her? She is my best friend
               and the only person who understands the
               real me. What will I do if I lose her? She
               could die. Anyone who does drugs knows
               the facts. We know that we could die. We
               know drugs are toxic, and that keeps us
               from doing them, to some degree. But
               why can't we stay away altogether?

  Dr. Balis:   How do you feel when you take drugs?

Ms. Ulreich:   I feel like I could fly into the clouds and
               never come down. I feel safe and happy. I
               feel like it never rains anymore. I feel
               wonderful. Maybe there is something in
               drugs that makes one feel happy and
               safe. Maybe they help me cope with my
               problems.

  Dr. Balis:   Hmm. How do you feel when you don't
               take drugs?

Ms. Ulreich:   Depressed. I feel unloved. Nothing makes
               me feel satisfied without drugs. I feel like
               I'm a piece of garbage.

  Dr. Balis:   What drugs have you tried?
Ms. Ulreich:   Marijuana, cocaine, heroin, LSD, and
               some other stuff. There's this one thing
               that makes me feel so high.

  Dr. Balis:   What is it?

Ms. Ulreich:   I don't know, but you mix it with alcohol
               and it makes you feel great.

  Dr. Balis:   Do you have a dealer?

Ms. Ulreich:   No, I don't know who gets them. Well, all I
               know is that the guys get them and bring
               them to a party. And the next thing you
               know you're high as a kite!

  Dr. Balis:   The guys get them?

Ms. Ulreich:   Yeah. Mostly football players. Some are
               basketball players.

  Dr. Balis:   The jocks?

Ms. Ulreich:   Yeah. We call them preps.

  Dr. Balis:   Preps? Why?

Ms. Ulreich:   It's the way they dress. They're the rich
               guys. You know the type: million dollar
               houses, hundred-thousand dollar cars,
               and outfits that cost more than an
               American-made mini van.

  Dr. Balis:   Hmm. Are they really that rich?

Ms. Ulreich:   They are. I've been to their houses.

  Dr. Balis:   Okay. Well, Nicole, what about your
               family? What are they like?

Ms. Ulreich:   I'm on my second stepfather. He has a
               great personality. He really loves my
               mother. He loves my half-sister, Dianne.
               She's three and a half.

  Dr. Balis:   I see. How does he feel about you?

Ms. Ulreich:   I don't know if he loves me. He complains
               about the music I like. He despises Angie.
               He hated my ex-boyfriend, Jeff. He hates
               all the things that make me me. Does that
               make sense?

  Dr. Balis:   Yes, it makes sense to me. How do you
               feel about him? Do you like him?

Ms. Ulreich:   Tom is great. He treats me well. He
               doesn't beat me or my mom.

  Dr. Balis:   Hmm. What about your mother?

Ms. Ulreich:   Mom? She's a wonderful woman. She is
               so great. Normally, she believes me about
               things, although lately she's turned into
               Tom. She's always loved Angie, and she
               knows Angie's problems. She knows that
               Angie's mom died in a car accident five
               years ago. But none of it matters now;
               now, she just wants to please Tom.

  Dr. Balis:   Nicole, you said you liked Tom.

Ms. Ulreich:   I used to. Now, I don't know.

  Dr. Balis:   Earlier, you said that he doesn't beat you.
               Have you been beaten by your father or
               stepfather in the past?
Ms. Ulreich:   My first stepfather beat me every night.
               He hated me. He thought that I was the
               biggest piece of trash to set foot on the
               Earth.

  Dr. Balis:   He beat you and told you that you were
               worthless?

Ms. Ulreich:   It made me feel awful. I thought he was
               supposed to love me. But he just beat me.
               He didn't care. He was a lot nicer before
               he married mom.

  Dr. Balis:   Do you need a tissue?

Ms. Ulreich:   Yes, thank you.

  Dr. Balis:   I know it was your mother's idea for you to
               come to see me. But I believe that if we
               spend some time talking together about
               your problems and how you feel about the
               world and those closest to you, it might
               really help you. What do you think,
               Nicole?

Ms. Ulreich:   Sure. Can you help Angie, too?

  Dr. Balis:   If she'll agree to come, I will help her.
               Otherwise, I can't.

Ms. Ulreich:   Why not?

  Dr. Balis:   I can't make decisions for Angie.

Ms. Ulreich:   Her grandmother can.

  Dr. Balis:   Is her grandmother her guardian?

Ms. Ulreich:   Yes.

  Dr. Balis:   Well then, Angie's grandmother has the
               right to make certain decisions.

Ms. Ulreich:   Doctor Balis?

  Dr. Balis:   Yes, Nicole?

Ms. Ulreich:   I'm afraid Angie's going to overdose. I
               mean, she could, any day now. I don't
               want her die. If she dies...

  Dr. Balis:   Do you have other people you hang out
               with at school?

Ms. Ulreich:   Yeah, Julie and Connor. They don't
               understand me like Angie does.

  Dr. Balis:   Have you thought about a peer group?

Ms. Ulreich:   A what?

  Dr. Balis:   It's a group that most schools run. It's a
               place where students can talk about their
               problems. You might find a new friend
               there. Try talking to your counselor about
               it.

Ms. Ulreich:   Okay. Maybe I can talk Angie into coming,
               too.

  Dr. Balis:   That's a good idea. I also think that telling
               Angie's grandmother about Angie's drug
               problem would be very valuable.

Ms. Ulreich:   Do you think Angie will forgive me?
        Dr. Balis:   She is your friend, and you would be
                     trying to help her. Why don't you try
                     talking to Angie first? Maybe you can get
                     her to ask for help on her own.

     Ms. Ulreich:    That's a great idea! I wish I had your
                     brain. Thank you, Doctor. And, please,
                     call me Nikki.

        Dr. Balis:   Nikki?

     Ms. Ulreich:    All my friends call me that. If I can trust
                     you enough to tell you my deepest,
                     darkest secrets, then I can tell you my
                     nickname.

        Dr. Balis:   Good.

     Ms. Ulreich:    I think my mother should be here by now.

        Dr. Balis:   All right. It was a pleasure to meet you,
                     Nikki.

     Ms. Ulreich:    Yeah. Bye, Doc.

        Dr. Balis:   I'll see you in two weeks, Nikki. That
                     would be Monday, April thirteenth at two
                     in the afternoon.

     Ms. Ulreich:    I'll be there.

        Dr. Balis:   Goodbye, Nikki.

                                          ###
